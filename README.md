SPAIC - Udacity | Facebook Secure and Privacy AI Challenge 2019.  

# Project MOST (SG_AIMLPros-MOST/Projects)

### Purpose 1: MOST - MOdeling and STatistics 
Implementing different models on same dataset | Providing statistics on "which is the most accurate model for image processing" through the details collected from the models implemented 

### Purpose 2:
Rice is the staple food for more than half the world's population;accordingly, its supply must double by 2050 to keep up with food demand from population growth. Nearly a fifth of the worldâ€™s population are rice farmers.However,they approximately loose 37% of their rice crop yields to various rice diseases.
