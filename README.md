SPAIC - 2019 Udacity Facebook Secure & Private AI Challenge Scholarship Program  


# Team MOST Project Showcase Challenge

Project <b>MOST</b>, as is suggested by the name, focuses on <b>MO</b>deling and <b>ST</b>atistics.  Its mission is to implement different models on the same dataset and provide statistics regarding the most accurate model for image processing through details collected from the models.

The goal of this project is to classify rice diseases using a rice disease dataset on Kaggle. By using various pretrained models such as VGG19 and ResNet50, we try to determine the best model for this task and analyze the pros and cons of each model, with the end goal of competing in the Udacity Facebook Secure & Private AI Scholarship Project Showcase Challenge.


# Project Overview:

Rice is the staple food for more than half the world's population; accordingly, its supply must double by 2050 to keep up with food demand from population growth. Nearly a fifth of the worldâ€™s population are rice farmers. However, they lose approximately 37% of their rice crop yields to various rice diseases.

<p>We came up with a model that classifies whether a rice leaf </p>

1) is healthy:

2) has brown spots:

<b><p>We believe that our classification model will help rice farmers better understand the condition of their rice crops and in turn lead to higher yields.

# Implemented model chart and details

# Analysis

### Test accuracy:
GoogleNet results had the highest accuracy (97%), followed by ResNext101_32x8 (81%), ResNet50 (79%, 10 epochs), ResNet50 (69%, 25 epochs), Alexnet (66%), and VGG19 (61%)

### Optimizers:
Two optimizers were selected: Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).  Adam is used by @Shudipto Trafder for training resnet 50, and the remaining models were all trained with SGD as an optimizer.

### Loss function:
Cross-entropy loss, or log loss, is used to measure the performance of all classification models in this project.

### Learning rate:
The learning rates of pretrained models selected in this project range between 0.001 and 0.003.
