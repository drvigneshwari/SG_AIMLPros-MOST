SPAIC - Udacity | Facebook Secure and Privacy AI Challenge 2019.  


# Team-MOST-Project-Showcase-Challenge

The goal of this project is to classify rice diseases using a rice disease dataset on Kaggle. By using various pretrained models such as VGG19 and ResNet50, we try to determine the best model for this task and analyze the pros and cons of each model, with the end goal of competing in the Udacity Facebook Private and Secure AI Scholarship Project Showcase Challenge.

## Project MOST (SG_AIMLPros-MOST/Projects)

### Purpose 1: MOST - MOdeling and STatistics 
Implementing different models on same dataset | Providing statistics on "which is the most accurate model for image processing" through the details collected from the models implemented 

### Purpose 2:
Rice is the staple food for more than half the world's population;accordingly, its supply must double by 2050 to keep up with food demand from population growth. Nearly a fifth of the world’s population are rice farmers.However,they approximately loose 37% of their rice crop yields to various rice diseases. 
We believe our model will help rice farmers know their rice crop’s condition ,hence leading to higher yields.
