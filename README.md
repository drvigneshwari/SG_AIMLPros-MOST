# Team MOST Project Showcase Challenge

Project <b>MOST</b>, as is suggested by the name, focuses on <b>MO</b>deling and <b>ST</b>atistics.  Its mission is to implement different models on the same dataset and provide statistics regarding the most accurate model for image processing through details collected from the models.

The goal of this project is to classify rice diseases using a rice disease dataset on Kaggle. By using various pretrained models such as VGG19 and ResNet50, we try to determine the best model for this task and analyze the pros and cons of each model, with the end goal of competing in the Udacity Facebook Secure & Private AI Scholarship Project Showcase Challenge.


# Project Overview:

Rice is the staple food for more than half the world's population; accordingly, its supply must double by 2050 to keep up with food demand from population growth. Nearly a fifth of the worldâ€™s population are rice farmers. However, they lose approximately 37% of their rice crop yields to various rice diseases.

# Implementation and Analysis

### Test accuracy:
GoogleNet results had the highest accuracy (97%), followed by ResNext101_32x8 (81%), VGG16 (81%), ResNet50 (79%, 10 epochs), ResNet50 (69%, 25 epochs), Alexnet (66%), and VGG19 (61%)

### Optimizers:
Two optimizers were selected: Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).  Adam is used by @Shudipto Trafder for training resnet 50, and the remaining models were all trained with SGD as an optimizer.

### Loss function:
Cross-entropy loss, or log loss, is used to measure the performance of all classification models in this project.

### Learning rate:
The learning rates of pretrained models selected in this project range between 0.001 and 0.003.  

### Results from analysis:

# Conclusion

GoogleNet is a class of architecture designed by researchers at Google. It was the winner of ImageNet 2014, and it is proven to be a winner for our rice disease project as well. Not only its architecture goes deeper, researchers also took a noval approach in its structure, the so called inception model:

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/08131905/temp10.png" width="400" height="300" title="hover text">
  </p>
</br>

As we can see, multiple types of feature extractors are present, which is drastically different from the sequential architectures of other models.  Also, the final architecture contains multiple inception modules stacked one over the other, which helps the model converges faster.  

Through implementation of the rice project, we have also found that GoogleNet is superior than AlexNet, Resnet50, Resnext101_32x8, or VGG19 for the purpose detecting rice diseases.

# Value behind this project

This project is the implementation of advanced Machine learning techiques which can create a great impact in the life of farmers and all the life existense in this world. The primary utilization of this project may greatly impact in the <b>domain of agriculture.<b> 

According to the research by Kihoro, J., Bosco, N.J., Murage, H. et al. SpringerPlus (2013) [2: 308. https://doi.org/10.1186/2193-1801-2-308], Investigating the impact of rice blast disease on the livelihood of the local farmers in greater Mwea region of Kenyamers, conveyed that <b>rice blast disease is the most destructive disease compared to other diseases the farmers mentioned that it is possible to harvest nothing when affected by the disease. </b>

### Percentage rice blast incidences in the various planting group from 2006 to 2010.

From this analysis, it is <b> predominantly highlighting the loss faced by the farmers in the Mwea region of Kenyamers. This loss is not limited to farmers of Kenya but also throughout the world. Hence, taking this problem statement forward we are trying to provide a better solution to identify the rice diseases using the best model out of other pre-trained models for image classification.
